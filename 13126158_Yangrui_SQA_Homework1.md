# My understanding of software quality assurance #




----------



- From my perspective, SQA goes throughout the entire Software life cycle. At the beginning of the project, there must be a strict project plan that describing the project process and what should do to assure the quality of software. SQA is not only the testing and code inspection but also rational design, the management of coding, the effective communication with customers, risk assessment and so on. As "Software Quality Engineering" write, testing is just a small part of SQE, it has wide scope. Even after the project delivery, SQA does not stop. Maintain and updating both need to assure the software quality.



- For the software quality definition, I think that  using limited cost to create high quality software is best. The high quality means that if the software implements the functions, if it has good maintainability, Scalability, usability and so on. Of course, the most important one is that if customers are satisfied with the delivery project.
